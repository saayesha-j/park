						<p>These days, exploring the great outdoors isn't always a priority when travelers are adding adventures to their ever-growing bucket lists. Technology has spread throughout the world, making it hard to catch someone without a smartphone in their hand. </p>

						<p>Over time, we have developed a shorter attention span and are often in search of instant gratification when it comes to entertaining ourselves. If going outside and hiking two miles fails to capture the imagination, we might decide to opt out and instead do something more engaging on our travels.</p>

						<p>Health and science experts have determined that deepening our connection to nature is extremely important for boosting our overall health, mood, and mental clarity. After all, we weren't meant to seclude ourselves indoors, staring at white walls for most of our days!</p>

						<p>There are endless benefits to spending time outdoors, and doing so is the perfect escape from the busy urban world we can get caught up in. If you're an avid traveler, being outside and taking the time to connect with nature is a welcome respite from hustling between sightseeing spots. It gives you time to recharge, soak up some sun, and restore your energy.</p>
