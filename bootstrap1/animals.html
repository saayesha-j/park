							<h3>Don't feed ducks bread. Here's what to give them instead.</h3>

						<img class = "featureImg" src = "duckling.jpg" width = "100%">
						<p>Countless movies, TV shows, and even comics depict the age-old tradition of feeding bread products to ducks at the park. But don’t be fooled: this stereotype is actually an unhealthy practice that could lead to malnourishment and other health problems for these epicurean waterfowl.</p>

						<p>But if you’re an animal lover determined to feed your local park’s residents, there are several healthy alternatives. Before you go stock up on snacks, though, always make sure you’re allowed to feed the critters in question—some areas’ rules are more lenient than others.</p>

						<p>The best advice we can give about feeding ducks (or other types of park fowl like swans and geese) is to imitate the types of food they naturally eat in the ponds and fields they call home. This means vegetables and nutritious grains work well, while processed “human” foods do not. Even though bread is typically made from grains, the breadmaking process renders it very filling with a relatively low amount of nutrients, two factors that can lead to malnourished ducks. Instead, try to stick with snacks that haven’t been highly processed.</p>

						<p>For vegetables, the most important consideration is making sure that the bits and pieces you offer are small enough for waterfowl to handle. Ducks and their relatives aren’t great at chewing—while their bills help break down food, they don’t have teeth, at least in the traditional sense. Cut salad greens, vegetable peels, nuts, grapes, and other produce into small pieces before you toss them to these birds.</p>

						<h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">The real Jurassic Park may have been in the Arctic</h4>
						<p class = "list-group-item-heading">When you imagine a dinosaur’s habitat like that you would see in Jurassic Park, a hot and humid spot filled with verdant greenery might come to mind. However, a growing body of evidence points to these prehistoric reptiles romping around in much chillier climates—as far north as the Arctic.</p>

						<h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">Drones revealed the intricate social likes of these killer whales</h4>
						<p class = "list-group-item-heading">Social relationships are crucial for so many animals, from humans—for whom loneliness has been recently deemed an “epidemic”—to wasps to so-called “Resident” orcas: killer whales in the coastal North Pacific who eat fish and live in matrilineal groups. A new study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B used drone footage to take a closer look at the social dynamics in a pod of Southern Resident orcas in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

						<p class = "list-group-item-heading">Turning off your lights at night may mean more than just saving energy. For migrating birds, bright buildings are just another of a long list of threats to their populations. Of the more than one thousand bird species that are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 92 are listed as endangered.</p>
